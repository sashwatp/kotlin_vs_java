# Introduction
As I am learning kotlin, I am impressed by the conciseness of the language and how it has tried solving some of the 
verbosity that comes with java. This repository can help you uncover these techniques by comparing code between Java 
and Kotlin. 

# How to follow examples
Each Java class has a corresponding kotlin file. I don't think I should be explaining anything else. Go ahead and start 
comparing the code yourself.
